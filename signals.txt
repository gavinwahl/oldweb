# Positive
- Complex link structures, not simply flat or hierarchical. Ubiquitous
  inter-sentence hyperlinks.
- Extraordinary depth of content in single topic, or extraordinary breadth of
  topics that don't seem to be related beyond being the hobbies of the author.
  Esoteric content is particularly valuable.
- Single author who is a personal enthusiast of the topics they discuss.
- Non commercial

# Negative
- Deprioritizing old content (most blog-style architectures). Old web content
  does not get less interesting with age.
